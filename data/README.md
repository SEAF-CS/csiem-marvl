For the aed-marvl scripts to work effectively, the data products from the `csiem-data` repository must be sourced and added to the `data` folder. For more information on the observed data available for these scripts, please visit the csiem-data [wiki](https://github.com/SEAF-CS/csiem-data/wiki).

Add the `mat` directory from `csiem-data/data-warehouse` into this folder, and refer to this folder's path in the marvl configuration files.
